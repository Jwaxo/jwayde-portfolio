ABOUT JESS WAYDE
--------------

Why would you be looking here for info on me? The actual site should have some,
at jesswayde.com. If you're not there, hey, thanks for checking out my repo.

HOW TO THEME
------------

From this directory, run `gulp dev`. This should begin watching all .scss
files in the scss directory and outputting any changes to app.css. All of the
rest should be the same as your typical Drupal theming.

ABOUT DRUPAL THEMING
--------------------

See https://www.drupal.org/docs/11/theming for more information on Drupal
theming.
